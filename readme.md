## Overview

Project Description (in detail):
This project is a multi-section web interface designed to showcase various themed headers and footers, each representing a unique brand concept. Built using HTML and CSS, the project demonstrates proficiency in responsive layout structuring, visual branding, and interactive user interface elements.
Each section includes:
A custom-designed header featuring navigation elements, logos, and social/media icons tailored to a specific brand.


A matching footer with copyright information, social links using Ionicons, and brand acknowledgments.


Consistent use of external CSS styling to maintain separation of concerns and allow scalable design.


The project features the following themed interfaces:


Holy Grounds (Coffee Shop): A faith-inspired café brand that blends spiritual comfort with the warmth of coffee culture. It serves as a welcoming space where community, reflection, and quality brews meet — grounded in values of peace, purpose, and hospitality.

ALT+F4 (Gaming Brand): A gaming hub built for enthusiasts, streamers, and digital warriors. ALT+F4 plays on the clever keyboard reference to quitting, representing both escape and immersion in another world — a nod to the balance between digital adventure and real-life passion.

Pokémon-Themed Website : A vibrant platform dedicated to Pokémon fans, celebrating adventure, discovery, and friendship. Whether you're a Trainer, collector, or fan of the franchise, this theme captures the excitement of catching, battling, and bonding in the Pokémon universe.

NEW GEN (Minimal Streetwear Brand): A trend-forward streetwear concept that speaks to a new generation of bold self-expression. NEW GEN promotes clean aesthetics, subtle rebellion, and a fashion identity that challenges the ordinary through simplicity and bold energy.

HeBrews (Coffee Shop): A Christian coffee brand that offers more than just beverages — it brews faith, fellowship, and flavor in every cup. “HeBrews” is a play on the biblical book and the act of making coffee, emphasizing community, Scripture, and daily inspiration.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
